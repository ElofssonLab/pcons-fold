	abstract = {{MolProbity} is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in {MolProbity} and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. {MolProbity} is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

	abstract = {Various approaches have explored the covariation of residues in multiple-sequence alignments of homologous proteins to extract functional and structural information. Among those are principal component analysis ({PCA)}, which identifies the most correlated groups of residues, and direct coupling analysis ({DCA)}, a global inference method based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims at predicting residue-residue contacts. In this paper, inspired by the statistical physics of disordered systems, we introduce the Hopfield-Potts model to naturally interpolate between these two approaches. The Hopfield-Potts model allows us to identify relevant 'patterns' of residues from the knowledge of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the residue-residue correlation matrix. We show how the computation of such statistical patterns makes it possible to accurately predict residue-residue contacts with a much smaller number of parameters than {DCA.} This dimensional reduction allows us to avoid overfitting and to extract contact information from multiple-sequence alignments of reduced size. In addition, we show that low-eigenvalue correlation modes, discarded by {PCA}, are important to recover structural information: the corresponding patterns are highly localized, that is, they are concentrated in few sites, which we find to be in close contact in the three-dimensional protein fold.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic {sequencing.In} this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the {3D} protein fold with remarkable {accuracy.We} quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom {3D} structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate {3D} protein structure to 2.7-4.8 Å C(α)-{RMSD} error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called {EVfold}, details at {http://EVfold.org).} This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

	abstract = {We compare results of the community efforts in modeling protein structures in the tenth {CASP} experiment, with those in earlier {CASPs} particularly in {CASP5}, a decade ago. There is a substantial improvement in template based model accuracy as reflected in more successful modeling of regions of structure not easily derived from a single experimental structure template, most likely reflecting intensive work within the modeling community in developing methods that make use of multiple templates, as well as the increased number of experimental structures available. Deriving structural information not obvious from a template is the most demanding as well as one of the most useful tasks that modeling can perform. Thus this is gratifying progress. By contrast, overall backbone accuracy of models appears little changed in the last decade. This puzzling result is explained by two factors-increased database size in some ways makes it harder to choose the best available templates, and the increased intrinsic difficulty of {CASP} targets as experimental work has progressed to larger and more unusual structures. There is no detectable recent improvement in template-free modeling, but again, this may reflect the changing nature of {CASP} targets. Proteins 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	issn = {0961-8368},
	shorttitle = {Pcons},
	abstract = {During recent years many protein fold recognition methods have been developed, based on different algorithms and using various kinds of information. To examine the performance of these methods several evaluation experiments have been conducted. These include blind tests in {CASP/CAFASP}, large scale benchmarks, and long-term, continuous assessment with newly solved protein structures. These studies confirm the expectation that for different targets different methods produce the best predictions, and the final prediction accuracy could be improved if the available methods were combined in a perfect manner. In this article a neural-network-based consensus predictor, Pcons, is presented that attempts this task. Pcons attempts to select the best model out of those produced by six prediction servers, each using different methods. Pcons translates the confidence scores reported by each server into uniformly scaled values corresponding to the expected accuracy of each model. The translated scores as well as the similarity between models produced by different servers is used in the final selection. According to the analysis based on two unrelated sets of newly solved proteins, Pcons outperforms any single server by generating approximately 8\%-10\% more correct predictions. Furthermore, the specificity of Pcons is significantly higher than for any individual server. From analyzing different input data to Pcons it can be shown that the improvement is mainly attributable to measurement of the similarity between the different models. Pcons is freely accessible for the academic community through the protein structure-prediction metaserver at http://bioinfo.pl/meta/.},

Therefore, perceptive of protein-ligand interaction will be very important for structure based drug design. Lack of knowledge of {3D} structures has hindered efforts to understand the binding specificities of ligands with protein. With increasing in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, homology modeling is rapidly becoming the method of choice for obtaining {3D} coordinates of proteins. Homology modeling is a representation of the similarity of environmental residues at topologically corresponding positions in the reference proteins. In the absence of experimental data, model building on the basis of a known {3D} structure of a homologous protein is at present the only reliable method to obtain the structural information. Knowledge of the {3D} structures of proteins provides invaluable insights into the molecular basis of their functions. The recent advances in homology modeling, particularly in detecting and aligning sequences with template structures, distant homologues, modeling of loops and side chains as well as detecting errors in a model contributed to consistent prediction of protein structure, which was not possible even several years ago. This review focused on the features and a role of homology modeling in predicting protein structure and described current developments in this field with victorious applications at the different stages of the drug design and discovery.},

Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program {PROSPECTOR\_3} and built the full-length models using {MODELLER} and {TASSER.} The {TM-score} of the initial threading alignments, compared to the {GDT} and {MaxSub} scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The {TM-score} is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent {CASP5} experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the {TM-score} is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions.

However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is incomplete. To shed light on repeat expansion mechanisms, we have studied the evolution of the muscle protein Nebulin, a protein that contains a large number of actin-binding nebulin domains. Nebulin proteins have evolved from an invertebrate precursor containing two nebulin domains. Repeat regions have expanded through duplications of single domains, as well as duplications of a super repeat ({SR)} consisting of seven nebulins. We show that the {SR} has evolved independently into large regions in at least three instances: twice in the invertebrate Branchiostoma floridae and once in vertebrates. In-depth analysis reveals several recent tandem duplications in the Nebulin gene. The events involve both single-domain and multidomain {SR} units or several {SR} units. There are single events, but frequently the same unit is duplicated multiple times. For instance, an ancestor of human and chimpanzee underwent two tandem duplications. The duplication junction coincides with an Alu transposon, thus suggesting duplication through Alu-mediated homologous recombination. Duplications in the {SR} region consistently involve multiples of seven domains. However, the exact unit that is duplicated varies both between species and within species. Thus, multiple tandem duplications of the same motif did not create the large Nebulin protein. Finally, analysis of segmental duplications in the human genome reveals that duplications are more common in genes containing domain repeats than in those coding for nonrepeated proteins. In fact, segmental duplications are found three to six times more often in long repeated genes than expected by chance.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein {3D} structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual information, taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible., Results: This article presents a novel method {PhyCMAP} for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual information, and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and, thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that {PhyCMAP} outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration., Availability:

We then use these correlations to predict contact maps for each of 11 protein families and compare the result with the contacts determined by crystallography. For the most strongly correlated residue pairs predicted to be in contact, the prediction accuracy ranges from 37 to 68\% and the improvement ratio relative to a random prediction from 1.4 to 5.1.

	abstract = {Spatially proximate amino acids in a protein tend to coevolve. A protein's three-dimensional ({3D)} structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the evolutionary record. Reverse engineering {3D} structures from such correlations is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the context of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method, applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard mean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified score for the coupling strength. The results are verified using known crystal structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families. Code implementing the new method can be found at http://plmdca.csc.kth.se/.},

The protocol for restrained refinement of protein {NMR} structures was also compared with restrained {CS-Rosetta} calculations. For proteins smaller than 10 {kDa}, restrained {CS-Rosetta}, starting from extended conformations, provides slightly more accurate structures, while for proteins in the size range of 10 - 25 {kDa} the less cpu intensive restrained-Rosetta refinement protocols provided more accurate structures.

	abstract = {Many proteins, especially in eukaryotes, contain tandem repeats of several domains from the same family. These repeats have a variety of binding properties and are involved in protein-protein interactions as well as binding to other ligands such as {DNA} and {RNA.} The rapid expansion of protein domain repeats is assumed to have evolved through internal tandem duplications. However, the exact mechanisms behind these tandem duplications are not well-understood. Here, we have studied the evolution, function, protein structure, gene structure, and phylogenetic distribution of domain repeats. For this purpose we have assigned Pfam-A domain families to 24 proteomes with more sensitive domain assignments in the repeat regions. These assignments confirmed previous findings that eukaryotes, and in particular vertebrates, contain a much higher fraction of proteins with repeats compared with prokaryotes. The internal sequence similarity in each protein revealed that the domain repeats are often expanded through duplications of several domains at a time, while the duplication of one domain is less common. Many of the repeats appear to have been duplicated in the middle of the repeat region. This is in strong contrast to the evolution of other proteins that mainly works through additions of single domains at either terminus. Further, we found that some domain families show distinct duplication patterns, e.g., nebulin domains have mainly been expanded with a unit of seven domains at a time, while duplications of other domain families involve varying numbers of domains. Finally, no common mechanism for the expansion of all repeats could be detected. We found that the duplication patterns show no dependence on the size of the domains. Further, repeat expansion in some families can possibly be explained by shuffling of exons. However, exon shuffling could not have created all repeats.},

We analyse pairs of positions with correlated mutations in 67 protein families and show quantitatively that the presence of such positions is a typical feature of protein families. A significant but weak tendency is observed for correlated residue pairs to be close in the three-dimensional structure. With further improvements, methods of this type may be useful for the prediction of residue--residue contacts and subsequent prediction of protein structure using distance geometry algorithms.

Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program {PROSPECTOR\_3} and built the full-length models using {MODELLER} and {TASSER.} The {TM-score} of the initial threading alignments, compared to the {GDT} and {MaxSub} scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The {TM-score} is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent {CASP5} experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment.

	abstract = {The fact that correlation does not imply causation is well known. Correlation between variables at two sites does not imply that the two sites directly interact, because, e.g., correlation between distant sites may be induced by chaining of correlation between a set of intervening, directly interacting sites. Such "noncausal correlation" is well understood in statistical physics: an example is long-range order in spin systems, where spins which have only short-range direct interactions, e.g., the Ising model, display correlation at a distance. It is less well recognized that such long-range "noncausal" correlations can in fact be stronger than the magnitude of any causal correlation induced by direct interactions. We call this phenomenon superadditive correlation ({SAC).} We demonstrate this counterintuitive phenomenon by explicit examples in (i) a model spin system and (ii) a model continuous variable system, where both models are such that two variables have multiple intervening pathways of indirect interaction. We apply the technique known as decimation to explain {SAC} as an additive, constructive interference phenomenon between the multiple pathways of indirect interaction. We also explain the effect using a definition of the collective mode describing the intervening spin variables. Finally, we show that the {SAC} effect is mirrored in information theory, and is true for mutual information measures in addition to correlation measures. Generic complex systems typically exhibit multiple pathways of indirect interaction, making {SAC} a potentially widespread phenomenon. This affects, e.g., attempts to deduce interactions by examination of correlations, as well as, e.g., hierarchical approximation methods for multivariate probability distributions, which introduce parameters based on successive orders of correlation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Employing methods to assess the quality of modeled protein structures is now standard practice in bioinformatics. In a broad sense, the techniques can be divided into methods relying on consensus prediction on the one hand, and single-model methods on the other. Consensus methods frequently perform very well when there is a clear consensus, but this is not always the case. In particular, they frequently fail in selecting the best possible model in the hard cases (lacking consensus) or in the easy cases where models are very similar. In contrast, single-model methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and could potentially be applied on any protein of interest to assess quality or as a scoring function for sampling-based refinement.
{RESULTS:} Here, we present a new single-model method, {ProQ2}, based on ideas from its predecessor, {ProQ.} {ProQ2} is a model quality assessment algorithm that uses support vector machines to predict local as well as global quality of protein models. Improved performance is obtained by combining previously used features with updated structural and predicted features. The most important contribution can be attributed to the use of profile weighting of the residue specific features and the use features averaged over the whole model even though the prediction is still local.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {ProQ2} is significantly better than its predecessors at detecting high quality models, improving the sum of Z-scores for the selected first-ranked models by 20\% and 32\% compared to the second-best single-model method in {CASP8} and {CASP9}, respectively. The absolute quality assessment of the models at both local and global level is also improved. The Pearson's correlation between the correct and local predicted score is improved from 0.59 to 0.70 on {CASP8} and from 0.62 to 0.68 on {CASP9;} for global score to the correct {GDT\_TS} from 0.75 to 0.80 and from 0.77 to 0.80 again compared to the second-best single methods in {CASP8} and {CASP9}, respectively. {ProQ2} is available at http://proq2.wallnerlab.org.},

Searching sequence databases is one of the most important applications in computational molecular biology. The main workhorse in the field is the {BLAST} suite of programs. Since the introduction of {BLAST} in the 1990's, important theoretical advances in homology search methodology have been made using probabilistic inference methods and hidden Markov models ({HMMs).} However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than {BLAST} by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases. Here I describe the acceleration methods I implemented in a new, freely available profile {HMM} software package, {HMMER3.} {HMMER3} makes profile {HMM} searches about as fast as {BLAST}, while retaining the power of using probabilistic inference technology.},

Appraisal of the known structures and their classification uncovers a straightforward relationship between their architecture and the length of the repetitive units. This relationship and the repetitive character of structural folds suggest rules for better prediction of the {3D} structures of such proteins. Furthermore, bioinformatics approaches combined with low resolution structural data, from biophysical techniques, especially, the recently emerged cryo-electron microscopy, lead to reliable prediction of the protein repeat structures and their mode of binding with partners within molecular complexes.

Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction.

Given the large amount of available sequence data, the analysis of co-evolution, i.e., statistical dependency, between columns in multiple alignments of protein domain sequences remains one of the most promising avenues for predicting residues that are contacting in the structure. A key impediment to this approach is that strong statistical dependencies are also observed for many residue pairs that are distal in the structure. Using a comprehensive analysis of protein domains with available three-dimensional structures we show that co-evolving contacts very commonly form chains that percolate through the protein structure, inducing indirect statistical dependencies between many distal pairs of residues. We characterize the distributions of length and spatial distance traveled by these co-evolving contact chains and show that they explain a large fraction of observed statistical dependencies between structurally distal pairs. We adapt a recently developed Bayesian network model into a rigorous procedure for disentangling direct from indirect statistical dependencies, and we demonstrate that this method not only successfully accomplishes this task, but also allows contacts with weak statistical dependency to be detected. To illustrate how additional information can be incorporated into our method, we incorporate a phylogenetic correction, and we develop an informative prior that takes into account that the probability for a pair of residues to contact depends strongly on their primary-sequence distance and the amount of conservation that the corresponding columns in the multiple alignment exhibit. We show that our model including these extensions dramatically improves the accuracy of contact prediction from multiple sequence alignments.},

The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 {CASP} experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in {CASP} testing. The nature of {CASP} targets has been changing in recent {CASPs}, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase ({SK)} and response regulator ({RR)} proteins and for homointeractions between {RR} proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

These genome sequences supply a wealth of information that can be exploited by statistical methods to gain significant insights into cellular processes. In Volume 422 of Methods in Enzymology we described a covariance-based method, which was able to identify coevolving residue pairs between the ubiquitous bacterial two-component signal transduction proteins, the sensor kinase and the response regulator. Such residue position pairs supply interaction specificity in the light of highly amplified but structurally conserved two-component systems in a typical bacterium and are enriched with interaction surface residue pairings. In this chapter we describe an extended version of this method, termed "direct coupling analysis" ({DCA)}, which greatly enhances the predictive power of traditional covariance analysis. {DCA} introduces a statistical inference step to covariance analysis, which allows to distinguish coevolution patterns introduced by direct correlations between two-residue positions, from those patterns that arise via indirect correlations, that is, correlations that are introduced by covariance with other residues in the respective proteins. This method was shown to reliably identify residue positions in spatial proximity within a protein or at the interface between two interaction partners. It is the goal of this chapter to allow an experienced programmer to reproduce our techniques and results so that {DCA} can soon be applied to new targets.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} The accurate prediction of residue-residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments ({MSAs)}, most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the {MSA} is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, {PSICOV}, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the {MSA.}
{RESULTS:} {PSICOV} displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation {\textgreater}23) was ≥ 0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.

Therefore, perceptive of protein-ligand interaction will be very important for structure based drug design. Lack of knowledge of {3D} structures has hindered efforts to understand the binding specificities of ligands with protein. With increasing in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, homology modeling is rapidly becoming the method of choice for obtaining {3D} coordinates of proteins. Homology modeling is a representation of the similarity of environmental residues at topologically corresponding positions in the reference proteins. In the absence of experimental data, model building on the basis of a known {3D} structure of a homologous protein is at present the only reliable method to obtain the structural information. Knowledge of the {3D} structures of proteins provides invaluable insights into the molecular basis of their functions. The recent advances in homology modeling, particularly in detecting and aligning sequences with template structures, distant homologues, modeling of loops and side chains as well as detecting errors in a model contributed to consistent prediction of protein structure, which was not possible even several years ago. This review focused on the features and a role of homology modeling in predicting protein structure and described current developments in this field with victorious applications at the different stages of the drug design and discovery.},

The efficacies of a wide variety of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent features of protein structures for recognizing native-like structures were systematically evaluated using ensembles of approximately 30,000 compact conformations with fixed secondary structure for each of 17 small protein domains. The best results were obtained using a core scoring function with P(sequence/structure) parameterized similarly to our previous work (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997;268:209-225] and P(structure) focused on secondary structure packing preferences; while several additional features had some discriminatory power on their own, they did not provide any additional discriminatory power when combined with the core scoring function. Our results, on both the training set and the independent decoy set of Park and Levitt (J Mol Biol 1996;258:367-392), suggest that this scoring function should contribute to the prediction of tertiary structure from knowledge of sequence and secondary structure.},

However, the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds 20\% on long-range contacts, falling short of the level required for ab initio structure prediction.
{RESULTS:} Here, we develop a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use {2D} recursive neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third, we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact prediction in the two most recent {CASP8} and {CASP9} experiments. For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new {CMAPpro} predictor is close to 30\%, a significant increase over existing approaches.

	abstract = {Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction, there has been relatively little connection between experimental protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order ({CO)} of the native structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction. Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high {CO} structures and an excess of low {CO} structures, as expected if the computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process. Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction in the {CASP4} (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment involved high {CO} structures likely to fold much more slowly than the lower {CO} structures for which reasonable predictions were made. This bias against high {CO} structures can be partially alleviated by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting out the higher {CO} structures, and eliminating the very low {CO} structures; this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies may be possible following significant increases in high-performance computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high {CO} conformations (high {CO} proteins can take six orders of magnitude longer to fold than low {CO} proteins). Importantly for such a strategy, simulations performed for high {CO} structures converge much less strongly than those for low {CO} structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence can indicate the need for improved sampling of high {CO} conformations. The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may extend to misfolding: The very low {CO} structures that accumulate in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.},

The main reason for this is practical: {BLAST's} programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the {HMMER} software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in {HMMER3} is to achieve {BLAST's} speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. {HMMER3} implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. {HMMER3} uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of {Karlin/Altschul} theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to {BLAST.} The {HMMER} project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.},

	abstract = {Particularly in higher eukaryotes, some protein domains are found in tandem repeats, performing broad functions often related to cellular organization. For instance, the eukaryotic protein filamin interacts with many proteins and is crucial for the cytoskeleton. The functional properties of long repeat domains are governed by the specific properties of each individual domain as well as by the repeat copy number. To provide better understanding of the evolutionary and functional history of repeating domains, we investigated the mode of evolution of the filamin domain in some detail. Among the domains that are common in long repeat proteins, sushi and spectrin domains evolve primarily through cassette tandem duplications while scavenger and immunoglobulin repeats appear to evolve through clustered tandem duplications. Additionally, immunoglobulin and filamin repeats exhibit a unique pattern where every other domain shows high sequence similarity. This pattern may be the result of tandem duplications, serve to avert aggregation between adjacent domains or it is the result of functional constraints. In filamin, our studies confirm the presence of interspersed integrin binding domains in vertebrates, while invertebrates exhibit more varied patterns, including more clustered integrin binding domains. The most notable case is leech filamin, which contains a 20 repeat expansion and exhibits unique dimerization topology. Clearly, invertebrate filamins are varied and contain examples of similar adjacent integrin-binding domains. Given that invertebrate integrin shows more similarity to the weaker filamin binder, integrin β3, it is possible that the distance between integrin-binding domains is not as crucial for invertebrate filamins as for vertebrates.},

However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90\%) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure.

Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by {DCA} can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

	abstract = {When researchers build high-quality models of protein structure from sequence homology, it is today common to use several alternative target-template alignments. Several methods can, at least in theory, utilize information from multiple templates, and many examples of improved model quality have been reported. However, to our knowledge, thus far no study has shown that automatic inclusion of multiple alignments is guaranteed to improve models without artifacts. Here, we have carried out a systematic investigation of the potential of multiple templates to improving homology model quality. We have used test sets consisting of targets from both recent {CASP} experiments and a larger reference set. In addition to Modeller and Nest, a new method (Pfrag) for multiple template-based modeling is used, based on the segment-matching algorithm from Levitt's {SegMod} program. Our results show that all programs can produce multi-template models better than any of the single-template models, but a large part of the improvement is simply due to extension of the models. Most of the remaining improved cases were produced by Modeller. The most important factor is the existence of high-quality single-sequence input alignments. Because of the existence of models that are worse than any of the top single-template models, the average model quality does not improve significantly. However, by ranking models with a model quality assessment program such as {ProQ}, the average quality is improved by ∼5\% in the {CASP7} test set.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of a protein's structure from its amino
acid sequence is a key issue in molecular biology. While dynamics,
performed in the space of two-dimensional contact maps, eases
the necessary conformational search, it may also lead to maps
that do not correspond to any real three-dimensional structure.
To remedy this, an efficient procedure is needed to reconstruct
three-dimensional conformations from their contact maps. RESULTS:
We present an efficient algorithm to recover the three-dimensional
structure of a protein from its contact map representation. We
show that when a physically realizable map is used as target,
our method generates a structure whose contact map is essentially
similar to the  target. furthermore, the reconstructed and original
structures are similar up to  the resolution of the contact map
representation. Next, we use nonphysical target maps, obtained
by corrupting a physical one; in this case, our method essentially
recovers the underlying physical map and structure. Hence, our
algorithm will help to fold proteins, using dynamics in the space
of contact maps. Finally, we investigate the manner in which the
quality of the recovered structure degrades when the number of
contacts is reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure is capable of
assigning quickly and reliably a three-dimensional structure to
a given contact map. It is well suited for use in parallel with
dynamics in contact map space to  project a contact map onto its
closest physically allowed structural counterpart.}

terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix and beta-strand
packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets (Simons

targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result
of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures
submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately
25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed
through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc
Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging:
highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for
MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue

The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences

been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions
in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important
shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly

combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted
from use in statistical physics. Applied to a  set of >2,500 representatives
of the bacterial two-component signal transduction  system, the
combination of covariance with global inference successfully and
robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without
resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions
between sensor kinase (SK)  and response regulator (RR) proteins
and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular
success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness  of the
global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based
on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable
soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only
1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues
to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the
potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on
the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the

method was used to measure the compensation  found in the four
residues at a pair of positions in any two sequences in a multiple

sufficiently flexible to consider a number  of amino acid relatedness

separation (in a protein of known structure) was compared to both
the mean pairwise separation over all residues and the pairwise
separation over an equivalent sample of pairs of residues selected

control that has been omitted from previous studies. The results
indicated that, at best, there was a slight effect  (of marginal
