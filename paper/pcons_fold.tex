\section{Motivation:}
A few years ago it was noted that the quality of protein contact
predictions could be improved significantly if direct and indirect
information was separated and sufficient number of homologous
sequences are available. It was shown that the contact
predictions alone contain sufficient information to predict the
structure of many proteins. However, since the first reports there has
been improvements in the contact predictions methods. Further there
also exist slower, but potentially more accurate methods to model the
proteins. Here, we ask how much the final models are improved if (i)
improved contact predictions are used and (ii) if Rosetta is used to
model the proteins. 



\section{Results:}
We find that on average the quality is improved with about 15\% when
the improved contacts from plmDCA are used and another 11\% when
PconsC is used. Using Rosetta instead of EVfold does not significantly
improve global model accuracy. Models generated with Rosetta contain 
more side-chain clashes than EVfold models, however backbone 
dihedrals are improved. Rosetta performs 14 \% better on proteins of 
the CATH fold class mainly alpha and 15 \% better on alpha \& beta.

\section{Introduction}
The protein folding problem is one of the longest standing problems in
structural biology. Although the problem itself remains largely unsolved,
there has been continuous effort and progress resulting in increased
accuracy of predicted models
\cite[]{kryshtafovych_CASP10_2013}. 

The idea of using predicted residue-residue contacts for protein
structure prediction is not new \cite[]{Vendruscolo9377713}. However,
until recently predicted contacts lacked the accuracy to facilitate
structure prediction methods significantly
\cite[]{marks_protein_2011}. This only became possible due to a new
approach to separate direct from indirect contact information
\cite[]{Weigt19116270,burger_disentangling_2010}.  Since then there
has been continuous effort to improve the quality of predicted
contacts \cite[]{morcos_direct-coupling_2011, jones_PSICOV:_2012,
  ekeberg_improved_2013, skwark_PconsC:_2013}.  In addition to the
initial predictions of soluble proteins \cite[]{marks_protein_2011}
and protein-complexes \cite{Schug20018738} now the predicted contacts
have also been applied in structure prediction of membrane proteins
\cite[]{hopf_three-dimensional_2012, nugent_accurate_2012}.


\begin{figure}[!tpb]%figure1

\caption{PconsFold pipeline. Based on a given protein sequence,
  amino-acid contacts are predicted with PconsC. These contacts then
  facilitate protein folding with Rosetta. In the end PconsFold
  outputs a structural model for the given
  sequence.}\label{fig:pipeline} 
\end{figure}

To optimize protein structure prediction from predicted contacts we
developed PconsFold, a pipeline for ab-initio protein structure
prediction of globular single-domain proteins
(Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}). PconsFold is based on predicted
amino-acid contacts from PconsC. These contacts are utilized within
Rosetta to fold a given protein sequence from scratch. We benchmark
our method on two datasets and compare it to EVfold
\cite[]{marks_protein_2011}, a previous method for contact based
protein structure prediction. The source code for PconsFold is
available on GitHub
(\url{https://www.github.com/ElofssonLab/pcons-fold}) under the MIT
license. It was found that the improved quality of predicted contacts
by PconsC~\cite{skwark_PconsC:_2013} increases quality and
native-likeliness of predicted structures by about 20\% over the
original EVfold and 10\% over EVfold using the improved contact
predictions from plmDCA~\cite{ekeberg_improved_2013}.

\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}

\subsection{Datasets}
During the development of PconsFold we used the proteins from
\citeauthor{jones_PSICOV:_2012} \citeyear{jones_PSICOV:_2012} (PSICOV
dataset). It consists of 150 single domain proteins with sequence
lengths between 75 and 275 amino acids. A list of all Protein Data
Bank (PDB) \cite[]{berman_protein_2000} and corresponding Uniprot
\cite[]{magrane_uniprot_2011} IDs is given in (Supplementary Table
T1). 


For each protein we chose to use its PDB seqres sequence as input and
not its atom sequence. This avoids internal gaps due to missing
residues in the crystal structure. We chose not to use Uniprot
sequences directly due to mutations and other sequential differences
to the PDB sequences. This allows direct comparisons between predicted
models and native PDB structures. Taking account for structural
differences due to diverging sequences is thus not necessary. 


For the final comparison between PconsFold and EVfold we used the set
of 15 proteins as in \citeauthor{marks_protein_2011}
\citeyear{marks_protein_2011} . PDB and Uniprot IDs are given in
Supplementary Table T2. Here we used the exact same sequences and
native structures as given in the publication.  

\subsection{Contact prediction}
In case of PconsFold, residue contacts are predicted with PconsC
\cite[]{skwark_PconsC:_2013}. The contact predictor plmDCA
\cite[]{ekeberg_improved_2013} is used by Rosetta/plmDCA and
EVfold. Rosetta/plmDCA utilizes the direct output from plmDCA. In
EVfold predicted contacts are further optimized according to
\citeauthor{marks_protein_2011} \citeyear{marks_protein_2011}
(supplementary information). PSICOV was used in Rosetta/PSICOV. 


Predicted contacts were ranked according to the confidence score
assigned by the respective contact prediction method. For each protein
we selected $n = f \cdot l$ top-ranked contacts, where $l$ represents
the length of the protein sequence and $f$ a factor to scale $n$
relative to sequence length. 


\subsection{Rosetta}
In PconsFold, Rosetta/plmDCA, and Rosetta/PSICOV we apply the
AbinitioRelax folding protocol \cite[]{rohl_protein_2004} of Rosetta
in version 2013wk42 \cite[]{leaver-fay_rosetta3:_2011}. The file {\tt
  abinitio.options} in the folder {\tt folding/rosetta} of the GitHub
repository lists all options we are using with AbinitioRelax. 

We employ the function \emph{FADE} to integrate predicted residue
contacts into the internal scoring function of Rosetta. \emph{FADE}
calculates the energy of a given contact as a function of the distance
$d$ between its residues as given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}%\label{eq:fade}
\textit{FADE}(d) = \left\{
\begin{array}{l l l}\label{eq:fade}
%2b_{low}^3 - 3b_{low}^2 + 1 & \quad \textrm{if d $<$ $c_{low}$} \\
%2b_{up}^3 - 3b_{up}^2 + 1 & \quad \textrm{if d $>$ $c_{up}$} \\
0.0 & \quad \textrm{for $d < lb$ or $d > ub$} \\
-2(\frac{d - \textit{lf}}{z})^3 - 3(\frac{d - \textit{lf}}{z})^2 + 1 & \quad \textrm{for $d < \textit{lf}$} \\
2(\frac{d - \textit{uf}}{z})^3 - 3(\frac{d - \textit{uf}}{z})^2 + 1 & \quad \textrm{for $d < \textit{uf}$} \\
w & \quad \textrm{otherwise.} \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

The parameters $lb$ and $ub$ are lower and upper bounds, $z$
represents the fading zone's width, $\textit{lf}$ and $\textit{uf}$
denote the inner boundaries for the fading zone $lb + z$ and $ub - z$,
respectively. The well-depth of the interval between both inner
boundaries is given by $w$. We set $lb$ to -10 \AA, $ub$ to 19 \AA\
and $z$ to 10 \AA. This defines a contact to be fully formed if the
participating residues are within 9 \AA\ of each other. The fading
zones allow for a soft margin between formed and non-formed
contacts. In terms of energy all non-formed contacts are ignored. In
our opinion this accounts best for the fuzzy nature of predicted
contacts. The fading zone at the lower bound allows Rosetta to detect
and resolve overlapping residues, i.e. when there is a negative
distance between two residues. 

\subsection{Model quality assessment}
In addition to internal Rosetta scoring we assessed the quality of all
predicted models with the model quality assessment programs (MQAPs)
Pcons \cite[]{lundstrom_pcons:_2001}, ProQ2
\cite[]{ray_improved_2012}, and DOPE from the Modeller software
package \cite[]{eswar_comparative_2006}. Pcons uses a comparative
approach and ranks all decoys according to pairwise structural
similarity between them. ProQ2 and DOPE assess single proteins and
evaluate structural features, such as side-chain placement and overall
shape. For our ranking we use the global score each MQAP assigns to a
predicted structural model (decoy). Residue-wise information about
local model quality is not used. 

For each structure prediction method all decoys were re-ranked with
each MQAP. The top-ranked model was then selected and compared to its
native structure. For this comparison we used the TM-score
\cite[]{zhang_scoring_2004} as a measure of structural similarity. As
native structure we used the PDB structure of each protein without
further loop-closing or other refinement. Tags from the seqres
sequences, although modeled, are therefore ignored in the structural
comparison.

The positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated to assess the quality of predicted models. It indicates how well a given contact map fits a given structure. All PPV values were calculated by using the C$^{\beta}$ (C$^{\alpha}$ in case of glycine) distances in the structure (native or model) with a cutoff at 8 \AA\ as reference contacts.

We used MolProbity \cite[]{chen_molprobity:_2010} to assess the chemical
model quality. The MolProbity tool {\tt oneline-analysis} was used to 
detect clashes and to evaluate backbone dihedrals as well as 
side-chain rotamers. To prepare the structures for this analysis, we 
first repacked all side-chains with the {\tt fixbb.linuxgccrelease} 
protocol from Rosetta using the options {\tt -packing:repack\_only}, 
{\tt -ex1}, {\tt -ex2}, {\tt -extrachi\_cutoff 0}, {\tt -ndruns 10}, 
and {\tt -minimize\_sidechains}. The Rosetta protocol 
{\tt relax.linuxgccrelease} was used to relax the structures with fixed backbone. The flags 
{\tt -relax:quick} {\tt -in:file:fullatom} {\tt 
-constrain\_relax\_to\_start\_coords} were set. Hydrogen atoms were then 
added with the MolProbity tool {\tt reduce-build}. All resulting 
structures are provided in the Supplementary Material.


\end{methods}

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{PconsFold}
\begin{figure*}[!tpb]%figure1
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/rosetta.eps}}
\caption{Predicted model quality in TM-score for adjustments of two
  different Rosetta parameters. Reducing the sample size in (a) from
  20,000 to 2,000 decoy structures results in reduced
  native-likeliness of predicted models. However, it also provides a
  10-fold speed-up. In (b) we adjust the depth parameter of the FADE
  function, used to score predicted contacts during folding. A larger
  absolute value increases the weight of such constraints and results
  in improved predictions.}\label{fig:ros} 
\end{figure*}
For all results in this section, we used the internal Rosetta score to
rank all predicted decoys. The top-ranked decoy structure was then
selected as a final model. With the {\tt -nohoms} flag during fragment
picking we ensured that all homologous structures are excluded. Only
fragments from non-homologous protein structures were selected. This
was done to simulate a real application case and not to overestimate
model quality. If not stated otherwise, we used all 150 proteins of
the PSICOV dataset as prediction targets in this section. 

Previous studies have shown that 20,000 -- 200,000 decoys are
necessary to sample native-like conformations without using spatial
constraints \cite[]{Simons10526365}. Figure~\ref{fig:ros} (a) shows the distributions of model quality, measured
in TM-score. We reduced the number of decoy structures from 20,000 to
2,000. This corresponds to a 10-fold decrease of runtime during the
folding step but also leads to an expected decline in average model
quality. On one core of an Intel E5-2660 (2.2 GHz Sandybridge), 
the generation of one decoy takes between 1 and 10 minutes for the 
shortest and longest protein in the PSICOV dataset respectively. To 
compute 2,000 decoys for each protein we ran 16 threads in parallel. 
Each of these threads then generates 125 decoys, starting with 
independent random seeds. With this setting it takes between two 
hours and nearly one day to generate all decoys for one protein. 
This simple scaling is possible since Rosetta runs are independent of each other 
as long as independent random seeds are provided. Increasing the number of 
threads can then be used to reduce total runtime or to 
generate more decoys in the same time. 

The increased bulk at ~0.3 TM-score in the second
distribution of Figure~\ref{fig:ros} (a) represents an increased
number of low quality models. We think the practical advantages of
massively shorter Rosetta runs outweigh slightly worse predicted
models. This parameter is therefore set to a default value of 2,000
but can be specified by the user via a command line argument. All
further results in this section are generated with this default
setting. 


We selected the FADE function to incorporate predicted residue
contacts into Rosetta's native energy function. We then adjusted the
parameter $w$ (well-depth) of FADE (Equation \ref{eq:fade}) on a
subset of 14 Proteins (Supplementary Table T3) of the PSICOV
dataset. The resulting TM-scores are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ros}
(b). The energy term from spatial constraints diminishes with
well-depth values of -0.5 and above. This leads to a significant
decrease in model quality. Lower values of -5.0 and below put a larger
absolute weight on the constraints resulting in higher model
qualities. We assume this is due to the small number of decoys we are
generating in this experiment. We selected a value of -15.0 to achieve
high model quality without outweighing Rosetta's native energy
function completely.


\begin{figure*}[!tpb]%figure1
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/tmscores.eps}}
\caption{In (a) the number of contacts used in structure prediction is plotted against average TM-score for three different methods: PconsFold (green circles), Rosetta/plmDCA (blue triangles), and Rosetta/PSICOV (black squares). There is an optimal number of contacts that depends on the contact prediction method. It also shows that increased contact prediction quality improves native-likeliness of predicted models. In (b) TM-scores are compared to the PPV of underlying contact maps for PconsFold (using PconsC). Mainly alpha helical proteins (blue) are easier to fold than alpha/beta or mainly beta sheet containing proteins.}\label{fig:main}
\end{figure*}

With any number of contacts used during structure prediction, the
resulting model quality is on average higher than it would be without
contact information. Figure~\ref{fig:main} (a) shows average TM-scores
for varying amounts of constraints. For each protein the number of top
ranked contacts was selected relative to its sequence length. A value
of 1.0 on the $x$-axis in Figure~\ref{fig:main} (a) represents one
contact per residue on average. The same Rosetta protocol as in
PconsFold (green circles) was also applied to contacts from PSICOV
(black squares) and plmDCA (blue triangles). Comparing $x=0.0$ to any
other $x$ shows that predicted contacts generally improve model
quality, regardless of method or amount of contacts. 


Improvements in contact prediction methods also increase the quality
of predicted structures. With a maximal average TM-score of 0.55
PconsFold, i.e. using PconsC contacts, provides a 10\% improvement
over using PSICOV or plmDCA contacts. This observation is consistent
with a direct comparison of contact prediction methods as in
\citeauthor{skwark_PconsC:_2013}
\citeyear{skwark_PconsC:_2013}. However, the performance difference
between PSICOV and plmDCA diminishes when their contacts are used in
structure prediction. 


There is an optimal number of contacts, specific to the contact
prediction method. In Figure~\ref{fig:main} (a) the maximal average
TM-score is reached at $x=1.0$ for PconsFold. For Rosetta/PSICOV and
Rosetta/plmDCA a smaller number of one contact every other residue on
average is optimal. This can also be explained by the quality of
predicted contacts. A larger number of top ranked contacts is
predicted with a higher quality in PconsC compared to plmDCA or PSICOV
\cite[]{skwark_PconsC:_2013}. Using more of these contacts during
structure prediction leads to improved models. 


This relation between contact and model quality can also be observed
in Figure \ref{fig:main} (b). For each protein in the dataset the PPV
of its contact map is plotted against the TM-score of the resulting
model. The overall Pearson correlation between PPV and TM-score in
this dataset is 0.59. Proteins with contact maps of lower quality tend
to be modeled less accurate. 


Proteins belonging to the {\it
  mainly alpha} CATH fold class seem to be easier to fold than
proteins from the {\it alpha \& beta} fold class and proteins from the
{\it mainly beta} fold class seem to be hardest to fold. The fold
classes are indicated by the color scheme in Figure \ref{fig:main}
(b). Predicted contact maps in mainly $\alpha$-helical proteins (blue)
have similar or lower PPV values than those of $\beta$-sheet
containing proteins (green and yellow), but the resulting models are
more accurate in terms of TM-score.




\subsection{Model quality assessment}
Table \ref{tab:qa} summarizes the evaluation of different MQAPs on the
predictions for the PSICOV dataset. It shows average TM-scores for the
top-ranked model after re-ranking all models with each MQAP. In all
cases the cumulative score for the full protein was used. Due to
technical reasons, Rosetta's internal scoring function was not
applicable to the models generated by EVfold. For PconsFold and
Rosetta/plmDCA the internal scoring was able to pick the best model on
average. In case of EVfold, Pcons selected the best models on
average. Pcons performed slightly worse than the internal scoring
function of Rosetta on the models from PconsFold and
Rosetta/plmDCA. ProQ2 did not perform well on EVfold models. ProQ2 performed slightly worse than
Pcons on models from PconsFold and Rosetta/plmDCA. We also tested a
combination of both, as in \citeauthor{wallner_pcons.net:_2007}
\citeyear{wallner_pcons.net:_2007}. However, the results are omitted
since they were not significantly different from those of Pcons
alone. DOPE scoring of EVfold models worked almost as good as Pcons,
but we observe a strong decline in average model quality for PconsFold
and Rosetta/plmDCA. We assume Rosetta scoring performed best, because predicted contacts
are part of the energy function. Models that satisfy predicted
contacts most optimally are assigned low energies and thus ranked on top.

\begin{figure*}[!tpb]%figure1
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/qa.eps}}
\caption{(a) PPV of the predicted contacts when using the native structures against the PPV in the top-ranked models. The color scheme represents TM-scores. (b) shows predicted contacts in the native structure of 1JWQ and (c) in the top-ranked model.}\label{fig:qa}
\end{figure*}

In Figure \ref{fig:qa} (a) PPV values for PconsC contacts on native structures ($x$-axis) are plotted against PPVs on the top-ranked models from PconsFold ($y$-axis). The colors represent the TM-score of the models against the native structures. With an average of 0.55 the PPV is higher for native structures than for the models, which have an average PPV of 0.47. The larger amount of points in the lower right triangle in Figure \ref{fig:qa} (a) indicates room for further improvement of the folding process. If the folding would use the contact information optimally, we would expect the majority of points being placed closer to the diagonal. In the region around PPV 0.4 and below, some models satisfy the constraints better than the native structures. This indicates that the folding protocol overfits the given constraints, resulting in low TM-scores (red color). 

In Figure \ref{fig:qa} (b) and (c) we examine one example of non-optimal folding more closely. Figure \ref{fig:qa} (b) shows the native structure of the protein indicated by the arrow in (a) (PDB ID: 1JWQ). We selected 1JWQ since it represents the worst-case scenario where the difference between native and model PPV is largest. The lines represent predicted contacts, colored according to the distance between their C$^{\beta}$ atoms. In case of glycine C$^{\alpha}$ atoms are used instead. The color gradient indicates distances ranging from 4 \AA\ in green over yellow at 10 \AA\ up to red for 20 \AA\ and above. With a PPV of above 0.8 most of the contacts were predicted correctly for this protein. This results in mainly green colored contacts in the native structure in (b). Looking at the contacts in (c) reveals that the helix at the bottom was not optimally packed in the model. Contacts colored in orange and red show that the distance constraints were not sufficiently satisfied by Rosetta. The overall PPV decreased below 0.5 for this model.

The analysis with MolProbity reveals that the backbone dihedral 
quality of Rosetta models is higher than for EVfold models. 
The percentage of Ramachandran outliers is 1.23 \% for PconsFold and 
17.26 \% in case of EVfold. This might be explained by the fragment based approach Rosetta is using to fold a protein. However, in the Rosetta models many steric clashes remain repacking the side-chains. MolProbity reports a clash score of 145.89 on average. The EVfold models seem to have a much smaller number of clashes. This is indicated by a lower average clash score of 29.93. 

An additional relaxation step with the Rosetta protocol {\tt relax.linuxgccrelease} with fixed backbone atoms to repack the side-chains resolves most of these clashes. On the relaxed models MolProbity reports an average clash score of 10.48 for PconsFold and 9.90 for EVfold. The percentage of Ramachandran outliers improves to 0.62 \% for PconsFold and 12.16 \% for EVfold. The average final MolProbity score on the relaxed models is 1.85 for PconsFold and 2.38 for EVfold. This corresponds to an average MolProbity percentile rank of 80.69 for PconsFold and 54.21 for EVfold.






\subsection{Comparison to EVfold}

Figure \ref{fig:vs} shows TM-score pairs for the top-ranked model for each protein in the PSICOV dataset. Pcons was used to rank all models. The TM-score for PconsFold (a) and Rosetta/plmDCA (b) is plotted along the $x$-axis. TM-scores for EVfold are plotted on the $y$-axis. Due to technical reasons there are no models for the protein with TM-score 0.0 for EVfold  (PDB ID: 1JBE). 1JBE was therefore excluded from all average TM-score calculations here and in the previous section.


When looking at Figure \ref{fig:vs} (a) the majority of alpha helical proteins (blue) achieved higher TM-scores with PconsFold than with EVfold. On average we see an improvement of 14\% of PconsFold over EVfold on alpha helical proteins. The same improvement can also be observed for Rosetta/plmDCA in (b). Together with Figure \ref{fig:main} (b), this indicates that Rosetta performs better on alpha-helical proteins. Further investigation is needed to see if this trend is merely due to a bias in the underlying dataset. The average performance of PconsFold on alpha \& beta proteins (green) is 15\% higher than for EVfold. However, Rosetta/plmDCA performs equally good as EVfold on average on such targets. The improvement might thus be due to PconsC contact maps, since it is only observable for PconsFold and not for Rosetta/plmDCA. At a level of single proteins we see quite some divergence between the results of EVfold and PconsFold in Figure \ref{fig:vs}. This is especially true for mainly beta (yellow) proteins in (a) and alpha \& beta as well as mainly beta in (b). 


Table \ref{tab:evfold} contains TM-scores for the top-ranked models of each protein in the small test dataset. We compare the EVfold results, as published in \citeauthor{marks_protein_2011} \citeyear{marks_protein_2011}, with results from the current EVfold version (web), EVfold re-ranked with Pcons, PconsFold, PconsFold re-ranked with Pcons, and PconsFold with 20,000 generated decoys. The results for the current version of EVfold were generated using plmDCA instead of DCA as in the published version. With an average TM-score of 0.55 EVfold using plmDCA performs 15 \% better than EVfold with DCA. When using PconsFold there is an additional improvement of 11 \% to an average TM-score of 0.61. This further supports our assumption that improved contact maps improve structure prediction. 

Re-ranking the predicted decoys with Pcons increases the average TM-score for EVfold and decreases it for PconsFold. No significant difference in average TM-score is observable then. Increasing the number of computed decoys to 20,000 improves the results for PconsFold by 5 \%. Due to the 10-fold increase in runtime, we suggest to use this setting only if maximum quality is required.
